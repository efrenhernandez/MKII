**MKII**

MKII is a project by Efren Hernandez and Isaac Hernandez that aims to portray what their parents saw when they would barge into the room and yell about how violent the game was before confidcating it. By isolating the blood and gore, this game shows the ridiculousness of taking in only one aspect of the game and ignoring all the rest.

This is only a placeholder README.
